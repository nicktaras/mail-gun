# mail_gun
A node js example of how to use mail gun to send mail.

## Dev Notes:

If you're like me and wish to test drive Mail Gun via the sandbox before connecting your own domain - you will need to authorise a test email address first.

To do so navigate to authorised users inside the dashboard. 

Once you have done this and updated the API and Domain variables in the node index.js file within this respository, you should now find that you can send mail to your email address via Mail Gun.
